<p style="font-family: 'EB Garamond', serif; font-size: 22px; color: #EBE3D5;">
Nearly a month has passed without me knowing it. Lately, Iâ€™ve been breaking my back to make our ends meet. 
It isnâ€™t a problem anyways. Iâ€™m still so glad that I got a job right on day one. However, that kebab shop is so 
poorly paid that, despite the kindness of the owner, I had to switch jobs after a few days. But luck is still with me 
- I got another job pretty easily. Being a kitchen porter is surely exhausting, still, the busy and wearying schedule 
cannot stop me from thinking about my loved ones. I missed little Maya so much - I just canâ€™t get her off my mind. I hope 
Mother is still doing okay and still able to take good care of Maya. Tomorrow will be the day that I receive my wages. Itâ€™s
nothing close to a good payout, but at least, itâ€™s enough to provide me with a basic life on this foreign land. My dear 
Marina, do you see me from up there? I hope youâ€™re still watching us and giving us your blessings. I and our family miss 
you and love you so much, always.
<br> Half past midnight.. I think I should go to bed. Tomorrow will be another long, busy and tiring day.
